### 1. Find the Number of Heightest candles

> Jig is having a birthday! She will have a cake with one candle for each year of her age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.

:question: Find and print the number of candles she can successfully blow out.

### 2.

There is a collection of N strings ( There can be multiple occurences of a particular string ). Each string's length is no more than 20 characters. There are also Q queries. 

:question: For each query, you are given a string, and you need to find out how many times this string occurs in the given collection of N strings.

> Input Format

> The first line contains N, the number of strings.
> The next N lines each contain a string.
> The N+2 nd line contains , the number of queries.
> The following Q lines each contain a query string.

### 3. Array Manipulation

> You are given a list(1-indexed) of size _n_, initialized with zeroes. You have to perform _m_ operations on the list and output the maximum of final values of all the  _n_ elements in the list. For every operation, you are given three integers _a_, _b_ and _k_  and  and you have to add value _k_ to all the elements ranging from index  to (both inclusive).

> For example, consider a list  of size  _3_. The initial list would be  _a = [0, 0, 0]_ and after performing the update  _0(a, b, k) = (2,3,30)_, the new list would be _a = [0, 30, 30]_. Here, we've added value 30 to elements between indices 2 and 3. Note the index of the list starts from 1.
